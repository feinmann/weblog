Now that I have a running Quarto Blog setup on GitHub, I want to look into themes.

## Change themes for your Quarto Blog

As described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html "https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html"), it should be pretty easy to set a different theme for the blog. I want to try the `united` theme of [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/ "https://bootswatch.com/"). So I just change the string in following file

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: united
```

That's it.

## But what about background-color?

Yeah, I found out how to change it, how do you like?
