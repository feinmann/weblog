Now that I have a running Quarto Blog setup on GitHub, I want to look into themes.

## Change themes for your Quarto Blog

As described [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html "https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html"), it should be pretty easy to set a different theme for the blog. I want to try the `darkly` theme of [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/ "https://bootswatch.com/"). So I just change the string in following file

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    theme: darkly
```

That's it.

## But what about background colors?

I also found out, that you can use your Inspector tool in firefox to identify certain elements of the blog, change some attributes and copy these new rules to your `styles.css` file. This file, if placed in the root of the blog, is set in the following way:

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
format:
  html:
    css: styles.css
```

So, just open the blog in firefox and hit `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open the Inspector. Then hit `Ctrl + Shift + C` to activate the select-tool. Hover over the blog and click a certain element. You can then discover the set properties. For example change the color using a comfortable color-picker. This will intermediately change the color. Right-click on the set property and copy the rule to your styles.css file. I played around with the inspector and copied the following rules:

``` {.html filename="styles.css"}
/* css styles */
.navbar {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items: center;
    -webkit-align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    -webkit-justify-content: space-between;
    padding-top: 0rem;
    padding-bottom: 0rem;
}

.quarto-title-banner {
    margin-bottom: 1em;
    color: #dee2e6;
    background: #627f37;
}

.quarto-title-banner {
    padding-top: 1.5em;
    padding-bottom: 1.5em;
}
```
