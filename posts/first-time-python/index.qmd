Ok, now that I like my setup more and more, and that I have also included `Julia`, I also want to use `Python`. (I think that I implicitly use jupyter here, as I now use `code` with the quarto-extension, but to be honest, I am not sure ðŸ™ˆ)

```{python}
1 + 1
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([0,1,2,3], [0,1,2,3], "-o")
plt.show()
```
