This is the first post in a Quarto blog. And since I do not know how to setup my gh-pages with it, I just write about how I found out.

#TODO (using RStudio Quarto Blog template)

Starting from [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html "https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html"), I decide to take route number 3 (Use a [GitHub Action](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action) to automatically render your files).

As recommended, I add the `/_site/` directory to my `.gitignore` file.
