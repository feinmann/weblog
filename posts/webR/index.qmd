## Brandnew webR setup in Quarto

Through mastodon I found a hint by Bob Rudis towards webR and got hooked. I took only a weekend to setup [Interactive Data Lessons](https://interactive-lessons.weecology.org/) by another mastodon user.

Here I give a short insight how you can setup your own webR instance within Quarto.

First, install the Quarto extension (requires Quarto \>v1.2):

``` {{bash}}
quarto install extension coatless/quarto-webr
```

Then add this to your YAML:

``` {{yaml}}
engine: knitr
filters:
  - webr
```

Now you can insert webR codeblocks by

``` {{webr}}
```

```{webr}

```
