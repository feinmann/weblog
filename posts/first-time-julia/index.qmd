Ok, now that I like my setup more and more, I also want to use `Julia` to show off.

![](images/image-1199289492.png)

~~First requirement: `r install.packages("JuliaCall")`~~ (I had to switch the render engine from knitr to jupyter, and there using the julia-1.8 kernel, because RStudio kept crashing...

```{julia}
1 + 1
```

But it works!!! For today I leave it like that. Tomorrow I will tackle the normal plot.

And here it is:

```{julia}
using Plots
using StatsPlots
using Distributions
```

```{julia}
plot(Normal(3, 5), lw = 3)
```
