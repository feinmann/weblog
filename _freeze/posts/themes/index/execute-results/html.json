I want to try the `united` theme of [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/ \"https://bootswatch.com/\"). So I just change the string in following file\n\n``` {.yaml filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: united\n```\n\nThat's it.\n\n## But what about background-color?\n\nYeah, I found out how to change it, how do you like?\n",
