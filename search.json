To store the token permanently, use the .Renviron file of your project.\nIt is really easy! But I don’t know why, I had to create the branch gh-pages on the remote manually to make the build-job work. Before github actions were failing with a error hinting to a missing _publish.yml.

This file, if placed in the root of the blog, is set in the following way:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\n\nSo, just open the blog in firefox and hit Ctrl + Shift + I to open the Inspector. Then hit Ctrl + Shift + C to activate the select-tool. Hover over the blog and click a certain element. You can then discover the set properties. For example change the color using a comfortable color-picker. This will intermediately change the color. Right-click on the set property and copy the rule to your styles.css file. I played around with the inspector and copied the following rules:\n\n\nstyles.css\n\n/* css styles */\n.navbar {\n    position: relative;\n    display: flex;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap;\n    align-items: center;\n    -webkit-align-items: center;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\n    padding-top: 0rem;\n    padding-bottom: 0rem;\n}\n\n.quarto-title-banner {\n    margin-bottom: 1em;\n    color: #dee2e6;\n    background: #627f37;\n}\n\n.quarto-title-banner {\n    padding-top: 1.5em;\n    padding-bottom: 1.5em;\n}"

(This effect was gone later…) So I search for some possibilities to adjust and here is a good starting point.\nHere I use the hash-pipe to set the layout, with one picture of width 100:\n```{python}\n#| layout: [[100]]\nplt.plot(x_axis, norm.pdf(x_axis, 0, 1))\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outer squared brackets indicate the whole layout, where the inner squared brackets are the first row, that is here filled 100% with one plot.\nIt is also possible to set more than one figure:\n```{python}\n#| layout: [[50, 50]]\nplt.plot(x_axis, norm.pdf(x_axis, 0, 1))\nplt.show()\n\nplt.plot(x_axis, norm.pdf(x_axis, 1, 2))\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some example code from the quartos docs, that I quite like. But in the quarto docs they use fixed image-files to simulate the output, where I use a duplicated codeblock, once with a header\n``` {{python}}\nand once as a normal codeblock with #| echo: false to suppress the output of the code, but to generate the figure.\nThis example code generates a tabset to compare python and R, I guess I will use this a lot in the future.\n\nJupyterKnitr\n\n\n```{python}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-cap: \n#|   - \"Line Plot 1\"\n#|   - \"Line Plot 2\"\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1,23,2,4])\nplt.show()\nplt.plot([8,65,23,90])\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-cap: \n#|   - \"Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars\"\n#|   - \"Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature\"\nplot(cars)\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed and Stopping Distances of Cars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature"
