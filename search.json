And since I do not know how to setup my gh-pages with it, I just write about how I found out.\n#TODO (using RStudio Quarto Blog template)\nStarting from here, I decide to take route number 3 (Use a GitHub Action to automatically render your files).\nAs recommended, I add the /_site/ directory to my .gitignore file.\nThen, in order to keep code only executing locally, freeze the computation\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\n\nNext, I create a file named publish.yml\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\nNow, I check everything into my git repository and push to github. gh-pages should be initialized and I am ready to go.\nAs described here I use {usethis} to initialize my github credentials, so first I have to install the package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nInstalling usethis [2.1.6] ...\n    OK [linked cache]\n\n\n\ncredentials::set_github_pat(\"<my-gh-PAT>\")\n\nIf you don’t have a PAT, follow the instructions in the link above. To store the token permanently, use the .Renviron file of your project.\nIt is really easy! But I don’t know why, I had to create the branch gh-pages on the remote manually to make the build-job work. Before github actions were failing with a error hinting to a missing _publish.yml. Here I found out about the missing branch."
