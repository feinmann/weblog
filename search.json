To store the token permanently, use the .Renviron file of your project.\nIt is really easy! But I don’t know why, I had to create the branch gh-pages on the remote manually to make the build-job work. Before github actions were failing with a error hinting to a missing _publish.yml.

This file, if placed in the root of the blog, is set in the following way:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\n\nSo, just open the blog in firefox and hit Ctrl + Shift + I to open the Inspector. Then hit Ctrl + Shift + C to activate the select-tool. Hover over the blog and click a certain element. You can then discover the set properties. For example change the color using a comfortable color-picker. This will intermediately change the color. Right-click on the set property and copy the rule to your styles.css file. I played around with the inspector and copied the following rules:\n\n\nstyles.css\n\n/* css styles */\n.navbar {\n    position: relative;\n    display: flex;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap;\n    align-items: center;\n    -webkit-align-items: center;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\n    padding-top: 0rem;\n    padding-bottom: 0rem;\n}\n\n.quarto-title-banner {\n    margin-bottom: 1em;\n    color: #dee2e6;\n    background: #627f37;\n}\n\n.quarto-title-banner {\n    padding-top: 1.5em;\n    padding-bottom: 1.5em;\n}"
